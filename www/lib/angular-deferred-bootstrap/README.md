# angular-deferred-bootstrap

> Initialize your AngularJS app with constants loaded from the back-end.

This component provides a global resolve function for your app. It works similar to the resolve functions you may know from ngRoute or ui-router: You define what needs to be loaded from the back-end before your application can be started and the deferred bootstrapper takes care of loading the data and bootstrapping the application.
